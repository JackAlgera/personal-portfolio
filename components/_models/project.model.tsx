Two of the most common algorithms are BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search). The most commonly used one in video games is A* (A-Star), which is the most efficient among the 3 I mentioned. But to start things of, I wanted to try implement the first two first, then later add the A* one.

          The simulation shows how each algorithm is working its magic and trying to find a path to the exit (red square in the corner) starting from the initial green square. I used an online maze generator that generated a nice .txt file filled with 0’s and 1’s, where 1 is a wall tile and 0 is a walkable path tile.

          I really like the visual effect we get from this project, gives us a nice insight of how the computer is “thinking” and trying to find the exit to a, rather, complicated maze !

          For some of these algorithms (Bubble and Merge) I used recursive programming. I have always found recursive programming incredibly elegant ; being able to create complex algorithms using only a couple lines of code is amazing.
          
          Although it is not used very often in the industry, I wanted to work on my recursive programming skills nevertheless ! Had loads of fun working on this project.

          When we were thinking of a name for the game, we wanted to come up with something original. In my mother tongue Afrikaans, "Huis toe" means coming/going home, so we decided to create an English / French spelling of the word, and thus the game was named.
          
          The story behind our game is that you, the player, has lost everything; your memories, your loved ones and your gems. Home, for us, is a safe haven, where we can find our loved ones, and keep our valuable earthly possessions safe!
          
          Explore the world and find the missing pieces. But don't stay away for too long, you might become a little homesick.
          
          As per usual, we split the coding between my brother and myself, while I did the game art and my brother did the game sounds and music. we had a third member that had the role of game dev, which really made the whole game creation process smoother !

          This year’s theme was "Sacrifices must be made". we immediately started the Jam out with a 2-hour brain storming session, using a mind map to lay out all our ideas. We usually start our game jams this way as it pumps us up for an intense weekend of coding and drawing !
          
          We decided to create a strategy / Survival game where you need to gain resources to increase your temple but still need to keep your favour high with the Gods, so that they don't bring their wrath unto you ! The more temples you have, the happier the Gods are, and if they ever tend to become too angry… you can always opt to sacrifice a small portion of your population to keep them happy !
          
          We had a lot of fun creating this game, I implemented an I.A system for the villagers to idly move around and perform activities. We also had the Gods bring forth storms and Death plagues, if ever they weren’t satisfied with the tribe !
          
          As per usual, we split the coding between us, while I did the game art and my brother did the game sounds and music.
          
          I Decided to timelapse the entire game jam. Sadly the software i was using stopped working a couple of times, so there are some gaps in the timelapse.
          
          Enjoy !

          You can collect coins and diamonds, that can later be used to unlock new scarfs for your ninja warrior. Bonuses can also be unlocked, like increasing the frequency of objects appearing and starting lower down the tower. You can choose between two different ways of playing the game ; by moving left and right by clicking on buttons or having the player follow your finger on the screen.
          
          I created this game as a first try of creating a proper android application. I implemented the ad system provided by unity. It was really fun, and I learned a lot program-wise. I also had a blast trying to create some pixel art for the game.

          We created an online multiplayer top down shooting game. As a player, you can choose between a couple of game modes (like weapons spawning randomly, 1 hp, battle royal etc.), as well as choosing a skin for your character. The game is played when you are the last player left standing.
          
          The game is played with up to 6 players online, via a SQL server. It is of course not the best method of creating an online multiplayer game, but we were just learning how to set up and handle a SQL server. 
          
          As Scrum master, I was tasked with creating the different user stories and assigning them to the other team members. I participated in the coding, creating the game visuals and animations as well as helping the other team members if they ever had trouble with their code.
