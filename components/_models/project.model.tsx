Two of the most common algorithms are BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search). The most commonly used one in video games is A* (A-Star), which is the most efficient among the 3 I mentioned. But to start things of, I wanted to try implement the first two first, then later add the A* one.

          The simulation shows how each algorithm is working its magic and trying to find a path to the exit (red square in the corner) starting from the initial green square. I used an online maze generator that generated a nice .txt file filled with 0’s and 1’s, where 1 is a wall tile and 0 is a walkable path tile.

          I really like the visual effect we get from this project, gives us a nice insight of how the computer is “thinking” and trying to find the exit to a, rather, complicated maze !

          When we were thinking of a name for the game, we wanted to come up with something original. In my mother tongue Afrikaans, "Huis toe" means coming/going home, so we decided to create an English / French spelling of the word, and thus the game was named.
          
          The story behind our game is that you, the player, has lost everything; your memories, your loved ones and your gems. Home, for us, is a safe haven, where we can find our loved ones, and keep our valuable earthly possessions safe!
          
          Explore the world and find the missing pieces. But don't stay away for too long, you might become a little homesick.
          
          As per usual, we split the coding between my brother and myself, while I did the game art and my brother did the game sounds and music. we had a third member that had the role of game dev, which really made the whole game creation process smoother !
