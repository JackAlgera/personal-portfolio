          I ended up creating a small web application that displays silly slang words. It uses the Urban Dictionary API to get a couple of slang words and stores them in a database that's only updated once a day (on the first call of the day).
          
          I used a SQL database hosted on Supabase to store the words, and used Next.js to create the web application. I also used Vercel to host the web application, with a custom domain name from Google Domains.
          
          The whole project ended up taking both the ride to and from my destination, so about 6 hours in total, with a couple of small tweaks here and there.

I then created an application, hosted on Google Play Store, that has two 2 buttons allowing us to plug into Firebase events, which get triggered from the Arduino. And of course, each trigger creates a notification for anyone subscribed.

When you can have fun creating a new project, and at the same time help someone out, I think there's no better way to spend your confinement ! 
          
          Previously, his dad would work on the layout of a building and determine where to place fire extinguisher to follow various norms and security protocols. This was done manually and took ages.
          
          The idea is to generate a PDF with various layouts, fire extinguishers and zones mapped out, as well generate an Excel doc that's used in his final report.
          
          The project was created with Java for the business logic, and JavaFx for the frontend UI components. I wanted to try create something without using any fancy REST endpoints, Queues or anything cloud-computing related !

          When we were thinking of a name for the game, we wanted to come up with something original. In my mother tongue Afrikaans, "Huis toe" means coming/going home, so we decided to create an English / French spelling of the word, and thus the game was named.
          
          The story behind our game is that you, the player, has lost everything; your memories, your loved ones and your gems. Home, for us, is a safe haven, where we can find our loved ones, and keep our valuable earthly possessions safe!
          
          Explore the world and find the missing pieces. But don't stay away for too long, you might become a little homesick.
          
          As per usual, we split the coding between my brother and myself, while I did the game art and my brother did the game sounds and music. we had a third member that had the role of game dev, which really made the whole game creation process smoother !

Through-out the game, the player realises that the current king is the evil one that has been lying to his people from the very start and the Trianglons are actually a civilized and kind people.

          We decided to create a strategy / Survival game where you need to gain resources to increase your temple but still need to keep your favour high with the Gods, so that they don't bring their wrath unto you ! The more temples you have, the happier the Gods are, and if they ever tend to become too angry‚Ä¶ you can always opt to sacrifice a small portion of your population to keep them happy !
          
          We had a lot of fun creating this game, I implemented an I.A system for the villagers to idly move around and perform activities. We also had the Gods bring forth storms and Death plagues, if ever they weren‚Äôt satisfied with the tribe !

          By clicking with the mouse, you can create an explosion of particles that shoot out in different angles. Learned a lot during this project, especially list-wise and handling a lot of data at the same time.

The rules are as follow :
          
          1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
          
          2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
          
          3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
          
          4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
