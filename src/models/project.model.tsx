It's a test of persistence, problem-solving, and sometimes, sheer determination. While the festive spirit usually calls for cozy mornings, I found myself waking up early each day, coffee in hand, ready to tackle the puzzles before diving into my regular workday.

          There were moments when the task felt tedious—sacrificing those precious hours of sleep during the coldest, darkest month of the year to decipher yet another tricky algorithm or debug a frustrating edge case. But each solved puzzle brought its own rush of satisfaction, and seeing my progress accumulate day by day made the effort worthwhile.
          
          Now that the challenge is over, I can finally relax and reflect with a sense of pride. Completing Advent of Code for yet another year is not just about the achievement; it’s a celebration of growth, resilience, and the joy of coding. It’s been a tiring but rewarding tradition, and I’m already looking forward to the puzzles of 2025!

          I like taking the train to travel around France, which gives me a bunch of free time on my trips.
          
          I thought it'd be cool to see how fast I could make something new from scratch, so I built a little web app that shows funny slang words. It grabs these words from the Urban Dictionary using their API and sticks them in a database that only updates once a day (the first time you use it each day).
          
          I used a SQL database (Supabase) to store the words, and I built the web app with Next.js. I hosted it on Vercel and got a custom domain name from Google Domains.

          For the backend, I plugged in an API layer over a...yes, a Google Sheets database (it was practical, I promise!). The Google Sheet was used to track guest RSVPs, making it the most convenient option for everyone involved.

To me, this felt like '20 seconds wasted just waiting for my coffee machine to warm up.'

          The setup uses an Arduino connected to the coffee machine through relays, simulating the physical button presses without the need for clunky robot fingers. On top of that, I deployed a web server on the Arduino that exposes endpoints, allowing me to schedule coffee-making times down to the minute.

          The Arduino is running a Jave/Spring based web server, that has a button/trigger that when pressed, sends a HTTP request to Firebase. I then created an application, hosted on Google Play Store, that has two 2 buttons allowing us to plug into Firebase events, which get triggered from the Arduino. And of course, each trigger creates a notification for anyone subscribed.

          Previously, his dad would work on the layout of a building and determine where to place fire extinguisher to follow various norms and security protocols. This was done manually and took ages.

Two of the most common algorithms are BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search). The most commonly used one in video games is A* (A-Star), which is the most efficient among the 3 I mentioned. But to start things of, I wanted to try implement the first two first, then later add the A* one.

          The simulation shows how each algorithm is working its magic and trying to find a path to the exit (red square in the corner) starting from the initial green square. I used an online maze generator that generated a nice .txt file filled with 0’s and 1’s, where 1 is a wall tile and 0 is a walkable path tile.

          I really like the visual effect we get from this project, gives us a nice insight of how the computer is “thinking” and trying to find the exit to a, rather, complicated maze !

          When we were thinking of a name for the game, we wanted to come up with something original. In my mother tongue Afrikaans, "Huis toe" means coming/going home, so we decided to create an English / French spelling of the word, and thus the game was named.
          
          The story behind our game is that you, the player, has lost everything; your memories, your loved ones and your gems. Home, for us, is a safe haven, where we can find our loved ones, and keep our valuable earthly possessions safe!
          
          Explore the world and find the missing pieces. But don't stay away for too long, you might become a little homesick.

          1) Each living cell has a certain time alive. As they become older, their colour either greys out (for predators) or becomes brighter (for prey).
          
          2) If a prey cell becomes fully aged (bright green) they reproduce on an empty cell.
          
          3) If a predator cell becomes fully aged (dark red) they die.
          
          4) Predators reproduce by eating prey and producing off spring based on the life left of the prey they ate.
